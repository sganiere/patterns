# REFINED DESIGN DOCUMENT

## BUSINESS POSTURE

The primary business goal of the system is to provide users with a flexible and efficient interface for querying AI systems using advanced prompts. The system aims to facilitate user workflows by allowing the creation, editing, and chaining of prompts, and by supporting multiple input formats and LLMs. The business priorities focus on user experience, system flexibility, and support for multiple AI models. The most important business risks include ensuring high availability and scalability, user data privacy, and maintaining compatibility with various LLMs as they evolve.

## SECURITY POSTURE

### Existing Security Controls

- **User Authentication**: Access to the web application is secured through user authentication.
- **API Key Management**: Secure management of API keys for accessing different LLMs.
- **Data Encryption**: Encryption of data at rest and in transit.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Manages user permissions effectively.

### Accepted Risks

- Users are responsible for managing their own API keys for LLMs.
- The system stores input and output data, which could include sensitive information.

### Recommended Security Controls

- Implement regular security audits and vulnerability assessments with specific schedules.
- Use rate limiting and monitoring to prevent abuse of the system and LLM APIs.
- Implement data anonymization techniques where possible.
- Consider encryption key rotation and data masking.

### Security Requirements

- Ensure data integrity and confidentiality.
- Provide detailed logging and monitoring for security incidents.
- Implement secure software development lifecycle practices.
- Ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations.

## RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical business processes we are trying to protect include the ability to create, edit, and manage prompts and workflows, as well as ensuring reliable interaction with LLM providers.
- We are trying to protect user input and output data, including prompt configurations, which may contain sensitive information. The sensitivity of this data depends on the user's specific use case and the information being processed.

## QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- **Questions**:
  - What specific data protection regulations apply to the data being processed by the system?
  - Are there any specific performance requirements for the interaction with LLM providers?
  - What is the expected scale of user interactions with the system?

- **Assumptions**:
  - Users will manage their own API keys for accessing LLMs.
  - The system will be deployed in a secure cloud environment with appropriate security controls.
  - The user interface will be designed with usability and security in mind.
